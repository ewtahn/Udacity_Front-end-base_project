              Alexis announced as Man of the Match
            </h1>
            <p><strong>Alexis Sanchez was voted Manchester United’s Man of the Match by fans on Twitter after a creative and energetic display saw him play a part in the opening two goals in Manchester United’s Emirates FA Cup win at Yeovil Town on Friday.</strong></p><p>The Chilean, who joined the club from Arsenal on Monday, had a hand in Marcus Rashford's opener at Huish Park, before providing the assist for Ander Herrera’s goal in the second half, as <a href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2018/Jan/match-report-yeovil-town-0-manchester-united-4-fa-cup-fourth-round.aspx" target="_self">the Reds cruised to a 4-0 win</a> to reach the FA Cup fifth round.</p><p>He picked up a huge 88 per cent of the final vote from supporters for his first performance in a United shirt, ahead of Michael Carrick and Rashford, who both received six per cent to the vote.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://mutv.manutd.com/" target="_blank">MUTV </a>after the match Jose Mourinho made it clear that Alexis’ bright performance was nothing he didn’t expect, saying: “No surprise. Nothing I open my mouth and am surprised about. I know him for many, many years and everyone knows his quality, attitude and what he can bring to the game. I’m really pleased, but we knew it when we were getting the player.”</p><p>His strong performance didn’t go unnoticed by opposition manager Darren Way, who joked on entering the media tent that his side could have done with an Alexis Sanchez. The Yeovil manger also went on to describe him as “absolutely world class”.</p><p>Skipper Carrick told <strong>MUTV</strong>: "He is not bad is he? Not bad for a little man. He is going to be a terrific player, he is a proper Man United player, and it's great to have him here.&nbsp;</p><p>"He is so exciting and so dynamic. He's always looking to create opportunities, to play forward and the fans are going to enjoy watching him, hopefully we will enjoy playing with him.”</p>

            <p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>• New contract sees the Portuguese committed to Old Trafford until at least 2020</strong><br> <br> <strong>Jose Mourinho has signed an extension to his contract at Manchester United in a move that sees him commit his future to the Old Trafford club until at least 2020, with an option for a further year.</strong><br> <br> Mourinho, who became the first United manager in history to win a major trophy in his first season when he secured the EFL Cup at Wembley last February, also led the club to success in the only competition it had never previously won, when he masterminded the UEFA Europa League win in Stockholm in May.<br> <br> Speaking of the new contract, Ed Woodward said:<br> <br> “Jose has already achieved a great deal as Manchester United manager and I am delighted that he has agreed to extend his commitment until at least 2020. His work rate and professionalism are exceptional and he has embraced the club’s desire to promote top quality young players to the first team. He has brought an energy and a sense of purpose to everything that he does and I am sure that will continue to bring results for the fans and the club.”<br> <br> Jose Mourinho said:<br> <br> “I am really honoured and proud to be Manchester United manager. I would like to say a big thank you to the owners and to Mr Woodward for the recognition of my hard work and dedication. I am delighted they feel and trust that I am the right manager for this great club for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> “We have set very high standards - winning three trophies in one season - but those are the standards I expect my teams to aim for. We are creating the conditions for a brilliant and successful future for Manchester United.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> “My thanks, of course, go to my staff and to my players; without their empathy and friendship this wouldn’t be possible. I love my players and it is a pleasure to know that we are going to be together for at least the next three years.<br> <br> “And I cannot finish without thanking the fans for their support and for making me feel at home so quickly. I repeat, to be Manchester United manager is an honour every day and I am really happy.”<br> <br> <strong>EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW</strong><br> <br> Watch our exclusive 17-minute interview with Jose on <a href="https://mutv.manutd.com/home?t=y&amp;utm_source=muwebsite&amp;utm_medium=in_page_text&amp;utm_campaign=mutv&amp;utm_content=mourinhoannoucementshow" target="_blank">MUTV</a>, <a href="https://mutv.manutd.com/home?t=y&amp;utm_source=muwebsite&amp;utm_medium=in_page_text&amp;utm_campaign=mutv&amp;utm_content=mourinhoannoucementshow" target="_blank">MUTV.com</a> and the <a href="https://mutv.manutd.com/home?t=y&amp;utm_source=muwebsite&amp;utm_medium=in_page_text&amp;utm_campaign=mutv&amp;utm_content=mourinhoannoucementshow" target="_blank">MUTV app</a> at 18:30 GMT, or on demand online.<br> <br> <strong>OPT-IN FOR EMAILS</strong><br> <br> This week we've emailed our fans with breaking news about Alexis's arrival and Jose's contract.

            <h1>Manchester United 3 Stoke City 0</h1>
            <p><em>Premier League | Old Trafford | Attendance: 74,726 | Scorers: Valencia 9, Martial 38, Lukaku 72.</em><br></p><p><strong>Antonio Valencia, Anthony Martial and Romelu Lukaku all scored as Manchester United cruised to a comfortable win over relegation-threatened Stoke City at rain-swept Old Trafford.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Valencia, who returned to the United line-up after being out since mid-December through injury, gave his side the lead inside ten minutes, when he curled in a shot with his left foot from inside the box. Martial increased the Reds' advantage before half time, with a brilliant strike from outside the box after being picked out by compatriot Paul Pogba. Lukaku later got in on the act, when he fired home to put the Reds firmly out of sight midway through the second half.<br> <br> Going into the game, Jose Mourinho was looking for his first win against the Potters since taking charge of United, after picking up three draws in his 18 months at the helm. His chances of a win were given a boost with a comeback for his recent captain, Valencia, and Lukaku making his first start of 2018.<br> <br> The hosts started well and had an appeal for a penalty turned down early on, when Martial fell in the box after colliding with Stoke City’s new signing Moritz Bauer. This did not dishearten the Reds who soon grabbed the lead, when Valencia scored with a stunning left-footed shot from sixteen yards.<br> <br> Stoke went into this fixture with new manager Paul Lambert watching from the stands and the Scot was of course hoping to see his side, who currently sit in the bottom three, put on a good performance. Following the opening goal, they had a chance to equalise, when Xherdan Shaqiri attempted a spectacular shot, but it proved to be a routine save for goalkeeper David De Gea. Stephen Ireland had an even more clear-cut chance to level, but his effort went wide when he was expected to score.<br> <br> Following the Potters' best spell of the game, Juan Mata and Valencia provided some good link-up play, but the Spaniard’s appeal for a penalty was again waved away by the referee Anthony Taylor, after falling inside the penalty box.<br> <br> However, the Reds' lead was eventually doubled before the break, when Pogba picked out Martial, who fired the ball into the top right corner from outside the box to score his tenth goal of the season. The Frenchman was eager for more and after Nemanja Matic dispossessed Ireland, he attempted to score a replica of his first goal, but this time his shot was blazed over.<br> <br> The visitors did still possess a threat, and they nearly had a route back into the game in first-half stoppage time. The ball broke to Shaqiri inside the box and his shot required an excellent save from De Gea to keep United’s lead intact at half-time.<br> <br> After the interval, Mourinho's men looked to make it 3-0 when Martial was through on goal, but Stoke keeper Jack Butland was able to smother the ball to prevent the Frenchman registering his second strike of the night. Lukaku attempted to get his name on the scoresheet, but his shot from just inside the box was saved by the England international.<br> <br> Just before the hour mark, Martial ploughed his way through the Stoke defence, and should have extended United’s lead, however his shot from close range was fired straight at Butland. Mata also had a chance after Lingard provided the lay-off, but the midfielder put too much power behind the shot, which went over.<br> <br> Lukaku had not scored a league goal for United since before Christmas, but he put that stat to bed midway through the second half after he forced his way through the Stoke defence and beat Butland at the near post.<br> <br> Marcus Rashford was brought on with ten minutes to go, and the youngster’s back-heel nearly made it 4-0, however Butland was able to prevent Stoke’s deficit increasing.<br> <br> The Potters posed very little threat in the second half with De Gea barely called into action, as United saw out a comfortable win to close the gap to the league leaders, Manchester City, to 12 points.<br> <strong><br> THE LINE-UPS<br> </strong><strong><br> United:&nbsp;</strong>De Gea, Valencia (c), Jones, Smalling, Shaw, Matic, Pogba, Mata (McTominay 83), Lingard (Fellaini 79), Martial (Rashford 79), Lukaku.<br> <strong><br> Subs not used:</strong> Lindelof, Rojo, Herrera, Pereira (GK).<br> <br> <strong>Stoke:&nbsp;</strong>Butland, Bauer, Allen, Zouma, Ireland, Choupo-Moting (Sobhi 61), Tymon (Wimmer 45), Martins Indi, Shaqiri, Fletcher (c), Crouch (Diouf 70).<br> <br> <strong>Subs not used:</strong> Afellay, Adam, Grant, Edwards.<br> <br> <strong>WHAT’S NEXT FOR UNITED?<br> <br> </strong>The Reds' next game is this weekend, with a short trip to Turf Moor to face Sean Dyche’s Burnley. The fixture is scheduled for Saturday 20 January in the Premier League with kick-off at 15:00 GMT.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> </strong></p>
